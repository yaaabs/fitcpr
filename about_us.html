<p style=" text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In 1936, the Commonwealth was two years old and independence was promised a decade hence. The FEU, a private education pioneer, took stock of the emergent nation’s needs. Among its findings was a very pressing need for engineers and technologists to help build the nation. It felt itself challenged and it thus established the Institute of Technology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">An increasing demand for trained engineers and technologists remained. With the government’s accelerated economic recovery program, private businesses establishing more and more factories, and agriculture shifting to mechanization, the demand for trained and skilled personnel was greater than ever. The Institute of Technology helped by filling the country’s needs in this respect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In 1936, when it was founded, the Institute of Technology initially offered a complete course in civil engineering. The Institute has since added complete courses in six other major fields of technology: architecture, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering, and chemistry. A course in geodetic engineering was also started in 1952. However, in 1971, the Department of Architecture was elevated into the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts and took over the architecture program; the course in chemistry was transferred to the Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1978.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The courses leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in a specific branch of engineering offered by the Institute of Technology were similar in some respects to those of the famed technical institutes and universities in the United States and Europe, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, Cornell University, and California Polytechnic. They, however, were oriented to suit local conditions and to fill the needs of Philippine technological advancement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The curricula of the Institute of Technology were geared to prepare the students to become highly technical yet practical experts in their specific branch of engineering. To achieve this end, the Institute of Technology has built a strong and well-balanced faculty.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It had a formidable teaching force, composed of the country’s esteemed technological educators and scholars, professors skilled and experienced in the basic sciences, trained technicians, and practicing and consulting professional engineers. The Institute of Technology was also continually expanding its facilities so as to provide its faculty and students with the most complete and modern laboratory in the country. It was in line with this policy that FEU built a seven-story Technology Building in Manila and a building complex on its 46-hectare Quezon City campus.</p>
